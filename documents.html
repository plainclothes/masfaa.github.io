        <li>Section 1: Retirement Gift/Honorary Membership - A gift may be given to a member retiring who has been active in MASFAA,
            RMASFAA and/or NASFAA. Gifts may also be given to a MASFAA member who is not retiring, but leaving the financial aid 
            profession. The amount spent on the gift would be decided by the Executive Board and would be dependent on the
            member's level of activity with MASFAA, RMASFAA, and/or NASFAA. Both gifts and honorary membership may be given retroactively.
            The honorary membership would be given only to retiring members. As an honorary member, the individual would not be
            required to pay membership dues but would receive mailing and would be eligible to attend conferences at the MASFAA membership

            RMASFAA, and/or RMASFAA. This is an annual award. However, if an appropriate recipient for any given year is

            nominations may come from the general membership.</li>
        
        <li>Section 4: Financial Aid Professional of the Year - An award to recognize a professional who has contributed
            to the financial aid profession in Montana in ways that often go unnoticed but without their contribution our
            profession and service to our students would be severely impacted. Nominations will be solicited from the
            membership. The Financial Aid Professional of the Year will receive a plaque and the possibility to receive
            up to a $1000 professional development grant.</li>

              constituents served. This statement should serve as a guide for organizational planning,
              decision making and priority setting, as well as developing the long-range strategic plan.

              properly managed. MASFAA is incorporated and tax-exempt under federal law and therefore, the
              Board's obligation goes well beyond its members. A well-developed annual budget will assist 
              in achieving this goal. All historical and current information pertinent to such discussions
              should be available and will be kept by the Secretary/Treasurer.</dd>

              competing priorities.</dd>

          <dt>2.6.5 Leadership Development</dt>
          <dd>Although the Association has a formal nomination and election process, it is the Board's responsibility to

         <dd>The site and dates of the annual conference will be determined two years prior to that 
             conference so that appropriate time is allowed for determining a site chair, booking a 
             conference facility and getting the MASFAA conference on the RMASFAA calendar. In order
             to maximize attendance of out-of-state professionals, every effort should be made to
             schedule the MASFAA conference without conflicting with any other RMASFAA states conferences.
             The Board should obtain the most current RMASFAA calendar before selecting conference dates. 
             In order to accommodate members limited travel budgets, the Board will schedule the MASFAA annual
             conference in conjunction with Department of Education training and, when offered, RMASFAA
             Decentralized training. Although any appropriate site in the state may be selected for the annual
             conference, the Board has set the following tentative order of state conference sites.</dd>
